SG Coal: Fleet Performance & Logistics Dashboard

​Project Overview

​This repository contains a data analytics project focused on South African mining logistics. The goal is to analyze haulage data to improve fleet efficiency and reduce operational costs.

​Data Insights (The "Why")
​Using a 50-row dataset, this project tracks:
​Fuel Efficiency (km/L): Identifying which trucks are over-consuming fuel.
​Driver Performance: Monitoring idling times that delay coal delivery.
​Route Optimization: Comparing "Pit-to-Crusher" vs. "Mine-to-Port" performance.

​Skills Demonstrated
​Version Control: Managed via GitHub for data integrity.
​Data Preparation: Structuring raw CSV data for Power BI ingestion.
​DAX Analysis: (In Progress) Implementation of logistics-specific measures.
