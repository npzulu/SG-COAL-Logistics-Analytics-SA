#SG Coal: Fleet Performance & Logistics Dashboard

​Project Overview

​This repository contains a data analytics project focused on South African mining logistics. The goal is to analyze haulage data to improve fleet efficiency and reduce operational costs.

​Data Insights (The "Why")
​Using a 50-row dataset, this project tracks:
​Fuel Efficiency (km/L): Identifying which trucks are over-consuming fuel.
​Driver Performance: Monitoring idling times that delay coal delivery.
​Route Optimization: Comparing "Pit-to-Crusher" vs. "Mine-to-Port" performance.

​Skills Demonstrated
​Version Control: Managed via GitHub for data integrity.
​Data Preparation: Structuring raw CSV data for Power BI ingestion.
​DAX Analysis: (In Progress) Implementation of logistics-specific measures.


#Added Data Quality Report

​1. Structural Integrity Check
​Column Quality: Verified 100% "Valid" status across all columns (TripID, Date, Tonnage, etc.) with 0% empty or error cells.
​Data Type Consistency: Ensured all numerical columns (Tonnage, Distance_KM) are cast as Decimal Numbers and the Date column is cast to the South African regional date format.
​2. Domain Logic Validation
​Instead of manual checking, the following Power BI Data Profiling tools were used to flag anomalies:
​Tonnage Thresholds: Used "Column Statistics" to verify that all loads are between 30 and 36 tons, aligning with standard coal side-tipper capacities.
​Fuel Logic: Confirmed through "Column Distribution" that no trips recorded zero fuel usage, ensuring cost calculations are accurate.
​Idling Analysis: Monitored the distribution of "IdlingTime_Min" to ensure no outliers existed that would skew the fleet utilization average.
​3. Ongoing Maintenance
​Because this project uses a Live GitHub Link, any new data pushed to the repository is automatically subjected to these same Power Query validation rules upon refresh.
